## Tasks Completed
-Imported the dataset using pandas 
-Counted number of movies in each genre and represented it in form of a bar graph
-Merged 3 datasets to form a master dataset for further operations
-Extracted keywords from each movie with help of stemming
-Sorted each movie based on popularity
-Used a count vectorizer to convert text into numbers
-Computed cosine similarity between movies
-Made a recommendation function to recommend movies based on selected movie

## Assignment Summary
